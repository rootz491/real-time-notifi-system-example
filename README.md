This repository contains the code for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kt1f5r7Tb4&t=943s explaining how to setup socket connections for features like real-time notification system in nestjs.

This code is partly taken from one of my personal projects. I have removed the most other parts from the code and kept only the socket connection part. As that code is not relevant to the video and is not open source.

PS: This is a very basic implementation of socket connections. It is not recommended to use this in production. This is just for learning purposes.
